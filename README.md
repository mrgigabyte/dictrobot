####Version 1.0 (current):
   * Basic code for setting up the bot instantly, still doesnt support languages other than English.

* Telegram account.
* Basic Knowledge about coding of course! 
* And the ability to read the manual patiently :D 

## How to install
* Get your own bot's token from [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather);
* Find out your account's unique ID (you can use [ID bot](https://telegram.me/my_id_bot) or just send message via Curl or something else and get `message.chat.id` from response JSON);
* Fill in the necessary variables in `config.py`;
* Start bot: `bash launch.sh`

## How it works
### Basic Functionality
This is an inline dictionary bot, meant to be used anywhere on Telegram instantly. Just simply mention the username of the bot followed by the word you want to search and you will have it!
